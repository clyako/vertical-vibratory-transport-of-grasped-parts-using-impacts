     * The user can send a user-controllable sawtooth current profile. This is what was used in the paper and video demos.
     * Potentiometers are used to change the height of the sawtooth ( @c _max_dac_value), the frequency ( @c _decrement_amount),
     * and the offset of the waveform ( @c new_voltage_offset_value). This function works by first writing @c _max_dac_value and
     * then decrementing an amount ( @c _decrement_amount) based on the desired frequency and the value @c _time_between_decrements.
     * This resets once @c _decrement_counter becomes less than zero (and the @c time_on_high_microseconds value is surpassed).
     *
     * @param time_on_high_microseconds How many microseconds to write @c _max_dac_value before decrementing again.
     * @param time_between_decrements_microseconds How many microseconds to wait before decrementing a value of 1 from @c _decrement_counter;
     * essentially controls the frequency of the sawtooth wave.
